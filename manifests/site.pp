## site.pp ##

# This file (/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/manifests/site.pp) is the main entry point
# used when an agent connects to a master and asks for an updated configuration.
#
# Global objects like filebuckets and resource defaults should go in this file,
# as should the default node definition. (The default node can be omitted
# if you use the console and don't define any other nodes in site.pp. See
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html#nodes for more on
# node definitions.)

## Active Configurations ##

# PRIMARY FILEBUCKET
# This configures puppet agent and puppet inspect to back up file contents when
# they run. The Puppet Enterprise console needs this to display file contents
# and differences.

# Define filebucket 'main':
#filebucket { 'main':
#  #server should point to one master that will be the file bucket
#  server => "${settings::server}",
#  path   => false,
#}
#
## Make filebucket 'main' the default backup location for all File resources:
#File { backup => 'main' }

# DEFAULT NODE
# Node definitions in this file are merged with node data from the console. See
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html#nodes for more on
# node definitions.

# The default node definition matches any node lacking a more specific node
# definition. If there are no other nodes in this file, classes declared here
# will be included in every node's catalog, *in addition* to any classes
# specified in the console for that node.

node default {
  # include base in all nodes
  include 'profiles::base'

  # Incude a role on any node that specifies it's role via a trusted fact at provision time
  # https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_facts_and_builtin_vars.html#trusted-facts
  # https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/ssl_attributes_extensions.html#aws-attributes-and-extensions-population-example
  if !empty( $trusted['extensions']['pp_role'] ) {
    include "roles::${trusted['extensions']['pp_role']}"
  }
}
